## Salary Information Disclosure Notice

This repository contains salary information disclosed by the author. **This disclosure is made pursuant to federally protected rights under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 151-169.**

### Legal Protections Notice

**IMPORTANT**: The discussion and disclosure of wage and salary information is protected activity under federal law. Specifically:

1. **National Labor Relations Act Protection**: Under Section 7 of the NLRA, employees at private-sector workplaces have the fundamental right to discuss wages and working conditions without fear of retaliation. This protection applies whether the workplace is unionized or non-unionized.

2. **Anti-Retaliation Provisions**: It is unlawful under federal law for any employer to discharge, discipline, demote, reduce hours, transfer, or take any other adverse employment action against an employee because they have discussed salary information or engaged in other protected concerted activity.

3. **EEOC Protections**: Under Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines, discussing salary information to uncover potentially discriminatory wages is protected activity under federal anti-discrimination laws.

4. **Additional State Protections**: Many states have enacted additional wage transparency laws that further protect employees' rights to discuss compensation.
